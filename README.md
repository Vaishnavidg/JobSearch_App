# JobSearch App

This is a Job Search App that is used to filter out employment based on the user's needs; it offers part-time, full-time, and contractor-based options. It displays popular jobs and nearby jobs. When clicking on a job, you will be able to discover information about the job, qualifications, and requirements. If you like it, you can apply it by clicking the apply button or mark it as a favourite.


Technically, it uses the React-Native framework and API fetching.
